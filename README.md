#RSS Feed Jasmine Testing

This application uses Jasmine-Jquery testing to ensure that an RSS feed provided by Udacity functions correctly. The test suites, in the file feedreader.js, test to ensure that the application's menu items load properly, that the CSS effects are applied properly, and that the asynchronous API calls to load content from an RSS feed work.

##How To Run

To run this application, please download this repository either as a ZIP file or through cloning the repository through the command line. The Jasmine tests can then be run through your browser by loading `index.html` in your select browser of choice.

##Dependencies

This application depends upon the jQuery, Jasmine, and Jasmine-jQuery libraries. All three libraries are included in the repository.
